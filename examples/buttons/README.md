# Buttons

This program waits for button presses on each of the buttons attached to a board
and toggles the LED with the same index. For example, if the first button is
pressed, the first LED is toggled. If the third button is pressed, the third LED
is toggled.

The program works with any number of buttons and LEDs on a board.
