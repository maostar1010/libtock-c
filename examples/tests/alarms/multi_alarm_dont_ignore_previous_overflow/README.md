# Test Multiple Alarms (Ensure previous overflowing alarms aren't ignore)

This tests the virtual alarms available to userspace. It sets three
alarms. The first two overflow and should result in multiple
alarms under the hood, and a third 10 second alarm started after the
second alarm fires. The first alarm is set first, but expires second
(1 second after overflow vs 10ms after overflow). The third alarm
should expire last.

(Not to scale; demonstrating alarm firing order)
Alarm 1 (Overflow + 1s) ---Set----------------------Fires--------------
Alarm 2 (Overflow + 10ms) --------Set------Fires -------------------
Alarm 3 (Overflow + 10ms + 10s) --------------Set------------Fires

When successful, the first alarm should fire after a clock overflow +
1 second, while the third should fire after a clock overflow + 10ms +
10 seconds.

If the virtual alarm library is buggy, this test might fail by never
firing the first alarm or firing it after the third alarm
(specifically almost another clock overflow) because either alarm
insertion or virtual alarm upcall handing misses it after the second
alarm fires.

# Example Output

Output includes three columns on each line:

1. the expected order of the alarm firing
2. the time the alarm is delivered to userspace
3. the time the alarm was set to expire

Correct (numbers for the nRT52840DK, running with a 32768Hz timer at
24-bits):

(after an entire clock overflow, ~8 minutes)
